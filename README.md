Welcome to my SQL Mastery Repository! Here, I've compiled all the knowledge and skills I've gained from my recent SQL course. This repository serves as a showcase of my expertise in SQL, encompassing a wide range of SQL commands and concepts, including Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Transaction Control Language (TCL), and Data Control Language (DCL).

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a comprehensive collection of SQL queries and scripts that demonstrate my proficiency in managing and querying relational databases. SQL is a powerful tool for working with data, and I've harnessed its capabilities to perform a variety of tasks efficiently.

## SQL Commands

### DDL (Data Definition Language)

DDL commands are used for defining and managing database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints. In this repository, you'll find examples of DDL commands for creating, altering, and deleting database objects.

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)

DML commands are used for manipulating data stored in a database. You can explore my DML queries that showcase how to insert, update, delete, and query data from database tables.

### TCL (Transaction Control Language)

TCL commands are used for managing transactions within a database. I've included examples of transactions, demonstrating how to commit or rollback changes to ensure data consistency.

### DCL (Data Control Language)

DCL commands are used for controlling access and permissions in a database. You'll find examples of DCL commands that illustrate how to grant or revoke privileges to users and roles.
